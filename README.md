# The Good People Shop

Milestone Project # 4 - [The Good People Shop](INSERT URL TO FINAL PROJECT)

The purpose of the site is a peer-to-peer shopping site. Buyers and Sellers will choose a verified charity to donate proceeds to.
Charities with no shop on the highstreet? That's fine, users can still sell items that they no longer need at home and buyers can purchase these items. 
All proceeds will go straight to the charity of their choice.
