            <p>
                We are a sibling trio. We loved volunteering our time to many wonderful charities growing up.
                There were times we wanted to donate to a cause when we couldn't volunteer, but we
                didn't have the hard cash to do so. We donated our previously loved items to charity stores,
                but found that charities we truly loved and wanted to doante to didn't have a store. So, we thought,
                surely there are other good people that want these donations
                that too want to donate to our favorite charities. So, then we created,
                <strong>TheGoodPeopleShop</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to make donating easy. Simply create an account, input details of your previously loved
                items on our simple form (make sure to add as much detail of the item and photos), then submit.
                You choose which charity you want the proceeds to go to. We partner with loads of amazing charities.
                Once that's all done, a good person will come around, buy your item and there we go! All the proceeds
                to your favorite charity and someone gets something out of it too. Start now!
